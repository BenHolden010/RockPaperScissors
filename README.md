# RockPaperScissors

### Abstract:

This is a website called rock paper scissors that allows a user to play against a computer. The game has a classic mode and a difficult mode. The difficult mode has rock, paper, scissors, lizard, and alien where each of these "fighters" will beat two other opponents. The rules for each of the fighters are written in their game select buttons. Once a game is selected from the home screen, the game will display the fighters. Select a fighter and the game will play and the result will be displayed and automatically reset shortly.

### Context:

This project took me 5 days to complete, I am currently in week 6 of mod1 at turing.

### Learning Goals:

The learning goals of this project were to practice creating a website using javascript, CSS, and HTML from blank files into a functional and aesthetic web page without other contributors.

### Wins + Challenges:

Wins: During this project I created a solid HTML and CSS file before I began writing javascript code. This helped me visualize how I would manipulate the structure of the web page to get my desired functionality before I even started the logic. I was also able to reach out to my rock to get help when I would be stuck on how to implement functionality which once I had a general idea I was able to refactor into a very dynamic function.

Challenges: I faced challenges getting my inner html to be manipulated by the user each time a new section was added. I was stuck on this for a few hours but once I decided to make a new html section just for the results display I was able to not only run the game but make the javascript more dynamic.
